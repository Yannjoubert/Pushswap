# Pushswap
Epitech Tech 1 Project

This project is constituted of two lists, "l_a" and "l_b". At the beginning, l_b is empty and l_a contains a certain amount of positive or negative numbers. The goal of the project is to fill l_a of l_b in ascending order. For this, we only have a certain operations.

* sa : swap the first two elements of l_a (nothing will happen if there arenâ€™t enough elements).
* pa : take the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list (nothing will happen if
l_b is empty).
* pb : take the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list (nothing will happen if
l_a is empty).
